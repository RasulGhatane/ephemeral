<p><em>Sofia Moretti:</em></p>



<p>*&#8221;Music was everything to me. From the time I was a little girl, it was my escape, my passion, my identity. It was more than just sound; it was the language of my soul. I remember the first time I picked up a guitar—I felt like I had found my voice. I poured my heart and soul into every note, every lyric, dreaming of the day when my music would touch others the way it touched me. I spent countless hours perfecting my craft, writing songs that were the truest expressions of who I was, hoping that one day, the world would hear them and understand.</p>



<p>But that day never came. Every door I knocked on stayed shut, no matter how hard I tried, no matter how much I believed in myself. Every opportunity I chased slipped through my fingers like sand, leaving me with nothing but empty hands and broken dreams. The rejections piled up, each one heavier than the last, until the weight of my failure crushed me. It wasn’t just my dreams that were shattered—it was a part of myself, the part that believed I had something to offer, something worth sharing with the world.</p>



<p>Now, I can’t even listen to a song without feeling that familiar sting of disappointment, that sharp reminder of everything I failed to achieve. What was once my greatest joy has become a constant reminder of what I couldn’t accomplish. The music I once loved now feels like a taunt, a cruel joke played by a world that never believed in me. The melodies that used to lift me up now drag me down into a pit of despair, reminding me of all the nights I stayed up late writing songs, of all the auditions that ended in tears. I’ve tried to move on, to find new passions, new dreams, but the shadow of my failed dreams follows me everywhere I go, like a ghost that refuses to be laid to rest.</p>



<p>I don’t want to hate music. I don’t want to feel this pain every time I hear a melody, but I can’t seem to escape it. It’s like the music has been poisoned, and no matter how hard I try to reclaim it, it only brings me pain. If I could just forget the dreams I had, the ones that never came true, maybe I could find peace. Maybe I could start over, with a clean slate, and find happiness in what I have now. I just want to live without this constant reminder of what I couldn’t achieve. Please, erase those dreams&#8230; erase the hope that turned to heartache, so I can finally be at peace, so I can finally stop hating the music that once meant everything to me.&#8221;*</p>
